A linter with autocorrection and a refactoring tool.

`recode` is an experimental project to play around with the great
[`sourceror`](https://github.com/doorgan/sourceror) package by @doorgan.

This library is still under development, breaking changes are expected.
The same is true for `sourceror` and most of `recode`'s functionality is based
on `sourceror`.

For now, `recode` corrects only a few things:

* `AliasExpansion` expands multi aliases
* `AliasOrder` orders aliases alphabetically
* `Format` runs the Elixir formatter
* `PipeFunOne` adds `()` to one arity functions in pipes
* `SinglePipe` corrects single pipes
* `TestFileExt` renames test file extensions to `*.exs`

It is also possible to run `recode` in a none-autocorrect mode to just lint your
code.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `recode` to your list of dependencies
in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
  def deps do
    [
      {:recode, "~> 0.4", only: :dev}
    ]
  end
```

`Recode` requires Elixir 1.13.0 or higher. If you add `recode` to a project that
supports lower Elixir versions you could add recode as following:
```elixir
  def deps do
    [
      # your deps
    ] ++ recode()
  end

  defp recode() do
    case Version.match?(System.version(), "~> 1.13") do
      true -> [{:recode, "~> 0.4", only: :dev}]
      false -> []
    end
  end
```

Documentation can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/recode](https://hexdocs.pm/recode).

## Usage

To start with Foo a configuration file is needed.

```sh
mix recode.gen.config
```

This mix task generates the config file `.recode.exs`.

```elixir
alias Recode.Task

[
  version: "0.4.0",
  # Can also be set/reset with "--autocorrect"/"--no-autocorrect".
  autocorrect: true,
  # With "--dry" no changes will be written to the files.
  # Can also be set/reset with "--dry"/"--no-dry".
  # If dry is true then verbose is also active.
  dry: false,
  # Can also be set/reset with "--verbose"/"--no-verbose".
  verbose: false,
  # Can be overwriten by calling `mix recode "lib/**/*.ex"`.
  inputs: ["{config,lib,test}/**/*.{ex,exs}"],
  formatter: {Recode.Formatter, []},
  tasks: [
    # Tasks could be added by a tuple of the tasks module name and an options
    # keyword list. A task can be deactived by `active: false`. The execution of
    # a deactivated task can be forced by calling `mix recode --task ModuleName`.
    {Task.AliasExpansion, []},
    {Task.AliasOrder, []},
    {Task.EnforceLineLength, active: false},
    {Task.PipeFunOne, []},
    {Task.SinglePipe, []},
    {Task.Specs, exclude: "test/**/*.{ex,exs}", config: [only: :visible]},
    {Task.TestFileExt, []},
    {Task.UnusedVariable, active: false}
  ]
]
```

### `mix recode`

This mix tasks runs the linter with autocorrection. The switch `--dry` prevents
the update of the files and shows all changes in the console.

## Differences to Credo

`recode` was started as a plugin for `credo`. Unfortunately it was not possible
to implement autocorrection as a plugin because Credo's traversal of the code does
not support changing the code.

Maybe some code lines from `recode` could be used as inspiration for `credo`
to bring the autocorrect feature to `credo`.

Other differences:

* `recode` requires Elixir 1.13, `credo` requires Elixir 1.7
* `recode` has autocorrection
* `credo` has much more checkers
* `credo` is faster
* `credo` has more features
